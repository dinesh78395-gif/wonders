    <h2>About Petra</h2>
    <p>
      Petra is an ancient city in Jordan, renowned for its rock-cut architecture and its history as the capital of the Nabataean kingdom. It was established around the 4th century BC by the Nabataeans, who were skilled in stone carving and water management, transforming the desert into a thriving trading hub. Petra's importance declined after the Roman annexation in 106 AD, and it was largely forgotten until its rediscovery in 1812.</li> </ul>
<h3>Nabataean Period (4th century BC - 106 AD):</h3>
<ul><li>The Nabataeans, an Arab nomadic tribe, settled in Petra and developed it into a prosperous city. They were known for their expertise in water management, using sophisticated systems of dams, channels, and cisterns to collect and distribute water. They also controlled the incense trade routes, bringing wealth and influence to Petra.</li> </ul>
<h3>Roman Annexation (106 AD):</h3>
<ul><li>The Nabataean kingdom was annexed by the Roman Empire and became the Roman province of Arabia Petraea.</ul> 
<h3>Decline and Rediscovery:</h3>
<ul><li>After the Roman annexation, Petra's importance gradually declined due to the rise of new trade routes and earthquakes that damaged the city. The city was largely abandoned by the 7th century AD. It was rediscovered by the Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt in 1812, who disguised himself as a Muslim pilgrim to gain access. </li></ul>
<h3>UNESCO World Heritage Site:</h3>
<ul><li>In 1985, Petra was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site, recognizing its outstanding universal value and significance as an archaeological and cultural site.</li> </ul>
<h3>Legacy:</h3>
<ul><li>Today, Petra is a major tourist destination and one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world, showcasing the ingenuity and artistry of the Nabataeans.</li> </ul>
