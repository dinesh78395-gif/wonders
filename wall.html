    <h2>About the Great Wall</h2>
    <p>
  
     The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications built over centuries to protect China's northern borders. Construction began in the 3rd century BC and continued through various dynasties, with the Ming Dynasty adding the most extensive and recognizable sections. The wall served as a military defense and a symbol of Chinese power and identity. 
     <h3>Early Walls:</h3>

<ul><li>Emperor Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of a unified China, connected and extended existing walls into a single defensive structure, primarily using rammed earth. </li></ul>
<h3>Han Dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD):</h3>
<ul><li>The Han Dynasty expanded the wall westward, particularly to protect the Silk Road trade routes.</li> </ul>
<h3>Ming Dynasty (1368-1644):</h3>
<ul><li>The Ming Dynasty oversaw the most significant expansion and fortification of the wall, using stone and brick to create the impressive structures visible today.</li> </ul>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<ul><li>The wall served as a military defense against nomadic tribes and other invaders. It also acted as a communication line, with watchtowers used to signal the approach of enemies. </li></ul>
<h3>Significance:</h3>
<ul><li>Beyond its military function, the Great Wall became a symbol of China's strength, resilience, and cultural identity. It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987</li></ul>.
