    <h2>About Chichén Itzá</h2>
    <p>
      Chichén Itzá was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya civilization in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. It served as a major political, cultural, and economic center for the Maya, reaching its peak between 750 and 1200 CE. The city is renowned for its well-preserved ruins, including the iconic Kukulkan pyramid, and is a popular tourist destination. </ul>
<h3>Founded by the Itzá:</h3>
<ul><li>Chichén Itzá was founded around 435 AD by the Itzá people, known as “water sorcerers,” who settled near natural wells called cenotes, giving the city its name—“At the mouth of the well of the Itzá”.</li></ul>
<h3>Sacred City and Pilgrimage Center:</h3>
<ul><li>It became a sacred site and a major pilgrimage destination for the Maya civilization, especially due to its cenote where offerings and sacrifices were made for centuries.</li></ul>
<h3>Architectural Fusion:</h3>
<ul><li>The city’s structures blend Maya, Toltec, Puuc, and Chenes styles. The Temple of Kukulcán (El Castillo), the observatory El Caracol, and the warrior columns reflect influences from central Mexico, especially the city of Tula.</li></ul>
<h3>Cultural Renaissance:</h3>
<ul><li>After a decline around 900 AD, Chichén Itzá saw a revival with new waves of Itzá settlers and Toltec influence, possibly linked to the arrival of Topilzin Quetzalcóatl, a Toltec ruler who brought the worship of Kukulcán to the region.</li></ul>
<h3>Political Powerhouse:</h3>
<ul><li>From the 10th to 13th centuries, Chichén Itzá dominated the northern Yucatán Peninsula as a political, religious, and commercial center, with a population possibly reaching 35,000.</li></ul>
<h3>UNESCO World Heritage Site:</h3>
<ul>In 1988, Chichén Itzá was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, honoring its historical and cultural significance. It’s also recognized as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.</li></ul>
