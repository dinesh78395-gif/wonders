    <h2>About Machu Picchu</h2>
    <p>
<h3>Commissioned by Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Machu Picchu was likely commissioned around 1450 by the Inca emperor Pachacuti as a royal estate following his military victories.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Royal Retreat and Sacred Site:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The citadel served as a secluded retreat and ceremonial center, possibly dedicated to the sun god Inti. It was never meant to be a permanent city.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Architectural Harmony:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Built in classical Inca style, Machu Picchu features dry-stone walls, terraced slopes, and structures like the Temple of the Sun and Intihuatana stone, designed to align with astronomical events.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Abandonment and Rediscovery:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The site was abandoned in the 16th century, likely due to Spanish conquest and disease. It remained hidden until American historian Hiram Bingham brought it to global attention in 1911.</li>
</ul>

<h3>UNESCO World Heritage Site:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Designated in 1983, Machu Picchu is now one of the New Seven Wonders of the World and Peru’s most visited tourist destination.</li>
</ul>
